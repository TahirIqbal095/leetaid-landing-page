# LeetAid Landing Page

Minimal Landing page for the LeetAid Chrome extension – AI, real‑time, context‑aware LeetCode hints without revealing full solutions.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 15 / React 19 (App Router)
- Tailwind CSS (custom OKLCH theme tokens in `app/globals.css`)
- next-themes (light/dark mode)

## How It Works (Extension)

1. Install from the Chrome Web Store.
2. Open the popup, choose a model, paste your API key (stored locally).
3. Visit any LeetCode problem – the chat buddy appears for incremental hints.
